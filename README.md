# First Repository

This is my very first repository with the Kekambas-137 Cohort!

### Git Commands
1. `git init` to create a new repository
2. `git add <filename>` OR `git add .` to add files to staged changes
3. `git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"` to commit (or take a snapshot)
4. `git add <remote_name> <remote_url>` to add remote connection to GitHub
    - `<remote_name>` will usually be `origin`
    - `<remote_url>` is the URL to GitHub repository
5. `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>` to send commits to GitHub
    - `<remote_name>` will usually be `origin`
    - `<branch_name>` will usually be `main`
    - can add `-u` flag to set up tracking
